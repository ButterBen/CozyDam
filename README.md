# Cozy Dam

This is a game I fully developed in one month by myself using Unity.  
Only the SFX and music were AI-generated or sourced from various free sound effect websites like [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).  
All assets and art where created by [Johannes Lott](https://www.johanneslott.com/) also check him out on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@jolottschannel)

A full playthrough can be seen here: [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z_k4NQLr1Y)  
The game was too large so the build is only included as a zip in this project file unfortunatly.

## Gameplay & Features
The game features the idea of a classic RTS. You can select your units and give them different things to do:
- Chopping down trees
- Farming
- building houses and dams
- as well as build roads and replant trees to create your own world

Below are some gifs of the various activitys. The game is lost once the water covers 60% of the available land. The environment is generated random each time for a fresh look every time.
